EPiServer.LiveMonitor


Installation
============

Starting from release 1.0.2, this add-on has been converted to standard nuget packages. 
This means that content files and assemblies will be added to the project.
As a part of the conversion the previously installed add-on packages needs to be removed.

New package format helps you install, or upgrade an existing add-on through Visual Studio, 
and install dependencies automatically, including OWIN, SignalR.
